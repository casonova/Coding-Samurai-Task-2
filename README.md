# Command-Line Weather Forecast Application

The Command-Line Weather Forecast Application is a Python program that allows users to retrieve current weather information for a specified location. This project leverages weather APIs, JSON data parsing, and user-friendly interface design to provide real-time weather data to users.



## Features

&#9679; **Location Input:** Users can input the name of a city or location to receive weather forecasts tailored to their chosen area.

&#9679; **API Integration:** The application utilizes a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch current weather data based on the user's specified location.

&#9679;**Display Weather Data:** Weather information, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy), is presented to the user in a readable format.

&#9679;**Unit Conversion:** Users have the option to choose between Celsius and Fahrenheit for temperature units, enhancing the application's usability for a global audience.

&#9679;**Error Handling:** The application gracefully handles scenarios where the user enters an invalid location or when the API request encounters issues, ensuring a smooth user experience.
